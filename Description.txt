"mod_reactor_controller": contains example files on how to connect and operate hardware (e.g. LEDs, fans, etc.) through Python code. 
Chiara has functional code for the stepper motor specifically - she can probably send that to you.

"multidradiometry": short for "multi-dimensional radiometry" - contains the code that was uploaded to GitLab by the original author Max and has the most extensive documentation.
Has separate measurement (radiometric_measurement) and evaluation (rm_evaluation) files. "evaluation_console" runs "rm_evaluation" using a file generated by "radiometric_measurement" (file format: .feather).
Maybe it helps you understand where the project was originally going before the files running on the lab computer were modified.

"radbox": contains "Class_Farbbild_AvaspecMini" which is the code actually being run by the box (not the latest version I wasn't able to copy from downstairs, I will send you that another time, but they should be almost identical).
This is probably what you should look into the most.
